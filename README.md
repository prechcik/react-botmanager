## React BotManager

BotManager is a simple React web application providing statistics collected by all of my public DreamBot scripts published on www.dreambot.org
The DreamBot scripts are made in Java for Dreambot framework and include a module that collects playtime data from every session.
All of usernames are encrypted before being sent to my servers to make sure that players identity remains hidden.

Current capabilities of the application:
- Total statistics for all the scripts
- Individual script statistics with user session details
- Individual user statistics
- Item prices are gathered by a separate script using RuneScape Wiki API ( https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Real-time_Prices )
